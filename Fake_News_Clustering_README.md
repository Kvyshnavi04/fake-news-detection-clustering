# Fake News Detection using Clustering

This project uses **unsupervised machine learning** to group and analyze news articles for potential misinformation.  
Text data is cleaned using NLP techniques and converted into numerical form with **TF-IDF vectorization**.

Two clustering algorithms are applied:
- **K-Means** to group similar news articles
- **DBSCAN** to detect dense clusters and possible outliers

The system helps identify hidden patterns in news content without relying on labeled data, supporting research in misinformation detection and media analysis.
